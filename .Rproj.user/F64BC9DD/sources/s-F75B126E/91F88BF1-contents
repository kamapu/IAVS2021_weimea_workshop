# CWM approach in functional trait ecology - R workshop (organised by David Zelen√Ω, #IAVS2021)

This website contains materials related to the workshop organized during the 63rd Annual Symposium of the International Association for Vegetation Science

## Description
Relating community-level functional traits to the environment is one of the fundamental tasks in functional ecology. One way to do so is to calculate community weighted means (CWM) of species traits, weighted by species abundances, and relate them to environmental variables. However, traditional parametric tests inflate Type I errors. In this workshop, participants will learn how to use the recently developed R package weimea, which contains tools suitable for running the permutation tests that overcome this problem within the CWM approach.

## Before we start
Please make sure that your computer is running the latest version of R (4.1.1 or newer) and RStudio (1.4.1717 or newer). With older versions of R we cannot guarantee the full functionality of the R code and <tt>weimea</tt> package. For detailed instructions how to install R & RStudio and update packages, visit [AnadatR website](https://anadat-r.davidzeleny.net/doku.php/en:r).

## If you never worked with R before
For this workshop, we expect that you will have intermediate level of R coding skills, and if you never worked with R, you may have difficulties to catch up. But if you have time to spare, you may walk through the series of five [Quick R Introduction tutorials](https://www.davidzeleny.net/wiki/doku.php/quickr:start), prepared for - yeah, quick R introduction. Each video (ca 30-40 minutes long) will walk you through the main features of R and RStudio. This may be also a good choice if you are familiar with R, but have not use it for a while.
